This information can be used to help make decisons about changing fare prices during certain days. One interesting thing is that all three city types have a peak in the last week of Febuary.

## Summary 
The Urban city type has the lowest average fare by driver and ride, I recommend  increasing the charge for these rides since it is heavily used in these cities.  
For all 3 city types there are peaks and valleys, I would suggest running promotions during times with lower fares in an effort to increase the number of rides in each city type. Finally The Urban cities appear to have signifcantly more drivers than rides, I recommend moving drivers to the other city types match demand in these cities.
